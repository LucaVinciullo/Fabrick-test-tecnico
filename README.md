# FabrickTestTecnico

This project is part of an application process.

## Project description

Creating a "new user" sign-up form by leveraging the [GO REST](https://gorest.co.in/) service.

## Environment Variables

Before running the application locally it is necessary to set up a `.env` file.
This file content is described by `.example.env`. <br>
Run `npm run config` to set your environment variables in `environments/environment.ts`. <br>
This script should always run before `ng` commands when running `npm run start|build|test`.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Live version

Live version is deployed with [Vercel](https://fabrick-test-tecnico-git-master-lucavinciullo.vercel.app/home).
